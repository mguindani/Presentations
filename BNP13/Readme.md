These are the slides of the presentation I have given at the 13th International Conference on Bayesian Nonparametrios (BNP13) which was held on October 24-28th, 2022 in Puerto Varas, Chile.

The Bayesian nonparametrics (BNP) conference is a bi-annual international meeting bringing together leading experts and talented young researchers working on applications and theory of nonparametric Bayesian statistics. It is an official section meeting of the Bayesian nonparametrics section of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis (ISBA) and is co-sponsored by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS).
